# Reverse Engineering Writeups

This repository showcases my hands-on learning and experimentation with binaries through reverse engineering challenges. It highlights my ability to analyze compiled programs, understand low-level execution flow, and apply static and dynamic analysis techniques to break down binary behavior in a structured and methodical way.

## Completed Challenges

1. **REVERSE - PICOCTF**
   #### Hardcoded key found in plaintext
   🔗 [REVERSE](https://github.com/drude087/REVERSE-ENGINEERING/blob/main/REVERSE/REVERSE.md)

2. **BBBBLOAT - PICOCTF**
   #### Key was stored in hexadecimal form. needed to convert it to decimal form to get the flag
   🔗 [Bbbbloat](https://github.com/drude087/REVERSE-ENGINEERING/blob/main/Bbbbloat/bbbbloat.md)
